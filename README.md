# Pythgon-Blackjack-Game
 implements a simple Blackjack game where the player plays against a computer opponent. The player can choose to hit or stand, and the game keeps track of the player's coin balance.


This code appears to be an implementation of a Blackjack game in Python. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

Imports: The code imports various libraries such as requests, cv2, os, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, and random.
Data Structures: The code defines several classes:
Card: Represents a single playing card with its mark, display name, number, and image.
Player: A base class for players, with a name and a list of cards.
Human: A subclass of Player representing the human player.
Computer: A subclass of Player representing the computer player.
Utility Functions:
load_image(): Loads a card image from a URL and splits it into individual card images.
create_cards(): Creates a list of Card objects using the card images.
show_cards(cards): Displays the card images using Matplotlib.
bet_coins(): Prompts the user to enter a bet amount (between 10 and 100 coins).
deal_card(player): Deals a random card to a player and updates their total number.
calc_ace(player): Adjusts the value of Aces in a player's hand if their total exceeds 21.
win(bet), lose(bet): Updates the player's coin count based on the outcome of the game.
choice(), enable_choice(string): Handles the user's choice to hit or stand.
Game Logic:
play_once(): Runs a single round of the Blackjack game, including dealing cards, handling the player's choices, and determining the winner.
is_blackjack(), is_bust(player): Check if the player has a Blackjack or has busted.
hit(bet), stand(bet): Implement the player's choice to hit or stand.
judge(): Determines the winner based on the final card totals.
show_result(result): Displays the final card hands and the game outcome.
Main Game Loop:
play(): The main entry point that loads the card images, creates the cards and players, and runs the game loop until the player runs out of coins.
In summary, this code implements a simple Blackjack game where the player plays against a computer opponent. The player can choose to hit or stand, and the game keeps track of the player's coin balance.
